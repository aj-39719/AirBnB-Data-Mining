# AirBnB-Data-Mining

Data Mining has found its use case in a wide variety of industries. One such field is the travel and tourism industry, where different type of data is gathered for each traveller, whether from booking a cab or from booking hotel accommodation. Our research in this report analyzes trends on data from the popular homestay and lodging website Airbnb for listed properties in London.

Exploratory data analysis of the raw data reveals some interesting insights into the London lodging market. Most properties listed in London are from Central London, particularly from regions like Westminster, Camden and Tower Hamlets. An analysis of the price per property reveals that Sutton is the cheapest and Kensington is the most expensive place to rent an Airbnb.

We implement traditional machine learning techniques to predict a customer’s review scores for a property based on various attributes related to customer experience, price, amenities and property owner. The bagging and boosting model worked well for most predictions but other methods aren’t far along. We conclude that our models have scope for further improvement if given access to more computational resources and are prone to the curse of dimensionality for some models.
